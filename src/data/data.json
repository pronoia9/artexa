Students will be presented with a methodology for relational database design using Entity Relationship Diagrams and normalization of data. Students will be introduced to a subset of SQL using IBM's DB2 on the iSeries platform. An overview of the functions of the Database Management System (DBMS) and of a Database Administrator (DBA) will also be presented.",

After successfully completing the subject, a student will be able to design and create web pages for web browsers, while applying knowledge of HTML5 technologies. Students begin by learning JavaScript, the programming language of the Web. Then, the Document Object Model (DOM) is studied, and with it, documents that use the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to define its structure and content. To affect and modify the appearance and formatting of a document, students learn and apply the foundations of the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language. Throughout this progression of topics, JavaScript is continually used to access and modify the content and appearance of documents through the DOM interface.",
